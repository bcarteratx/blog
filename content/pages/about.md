After studying Industrial Design at the Art Institute of Portland, and working for 10 years in the Fine Art printing industry, I recently relocated from Portland to Austin to explore not only a new city and culture but new career possibilities as well. Always eager to learn, I enjoy improving my skills in programming, electronics, photography, and music production.
